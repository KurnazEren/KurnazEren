# 💫 About Me:
Data Scientist | ML & Deep Learning | Psychology-Informed AI

I’m a Data Scientist with a unique background in Clinical Psychology and hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. I build end-to-end solutions that turn complex data into clear, actionable insights.

Before transitioning into tech, I worked in Clinical Psychology—developing a deep understanding of human behavior, analytical rigor, and a research-driven mindset. Today, I combine that perspective with cutting-edge technology to:

Design and deploy scalable ML pipelines (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn)

Build and optimize computer vision models (image classification, object detection, segmentation)

Translate business goals into data-informed strategies in both solo and agile team settings

What excites me most is working at the intersection of AI and human behavior: discovering behavioral patterns, validating models through robust experimentation, and ensuring ethical, human-centered AI.

I stay up to date with advances in NLP, generative AI, and reinforcement learning.
